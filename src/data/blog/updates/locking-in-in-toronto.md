Today I'm leaving Toronto and returning to Waterloo. It's a bittersweet feeling. After four months in the big city, it's difficult to leave. During my internship, I committed to working hard. The past few months have been surreal, but I believe I have learned a lot. I'll miss Toronto, but maybe I'll get to return soon.

Now I'm looking forward to my next adventure.
