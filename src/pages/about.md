I'm Yuto. I'm a second year CS student at the University of Waterloo. I am interested in algorithms, deep learning, and C++ programming. I'm hooked on the thrill of solving challenging problems.

I'm extremely interested in mathematics and computer science, and I have actively engaged in solving LeetCode problems and developing personal projects.

I like to travel and explore, especially big cities like Toronto and Tokyo when I go back to visit family. When I'm relaxing, I work on fun side projects, and play the piano.
